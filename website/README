wwwsearch.sourceforge.net website source files.

The wwwsearch.sourceforge.net website is maintained as a bunch of
files in a private staging git repository that gets rsynced to SF.

Some of the files are generated by release.py in the mechanize git
repository.  Some of the source files are here, and the rest are in
the mechanize repository:
