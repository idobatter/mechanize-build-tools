wwwsearch.sourceforge.net website source files.

The wwwsearch.sourceforge.net website is maintained as a bunch of
files in a private staging git repository that gets rsynced to SF.

Some of the files are generated: .html from source .html.in files, and
source distributions generated by the release process.  The generated
files are created by release_mechanize.py.  Some of the source files
are here, and the rest are in the mechanize repository:
